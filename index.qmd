## Outline: PPG Phase II

- World Ferns
- Darwin Core (DwC)
- ~~PPG Editor~~ WFO and Rhakhis
- Beyond Phase II

# PPG Phase II

## PPG Phase II

- We have been working on Phase I (genus level and higher)

- During Phase II, we will develop the **species-level** taxonomy

- We will officially start on Phase II after publishing PPG II at the genus level and higher (ca. Winter 2024)

## Decision making process for PPG Phase II

- No community-wide voting (too many names!)

- Instead, establish committees for smaller groups (genera, families)
  - Need to consider how regional specialists fit into this model

- Committees will edit the data directly\*

## Data for Phase II

- There are more than 12,000 accepted species and **50,000** synonyms 

- Compiling these data is a huge task!

- Fortunately, there is an existing database that we can use...

# World Ferns

## World Ferns (WF)

- Taxonomic database for ferns and lycophytes maintained by Michael Hassler since 1994
- 69,231 names total\*
  - 13,141 accepted species
  - 816 hybrids
  - 953 accepted infraspecific taxa 
  - **54,321 synonyms**

::: {.aside}
\*Version 24.7 (July 18th, 2024)

## Usage of World Ferns

- The World Ferns database is very valuable because of its **comprehensive treatment of synonyms**
- Used by
  - [Catalog of Life](https://www.catalogueoflife.org/)
  - [Pteridoportal](https://www.pteridoportal.org/portal/index.php)
  - [GBIF](https://www.gbif.org/) (via Catalog of Life)

## Taxonomic treatment of WF

- Mostly follows PPG I (2016)
- But there have been many changes since
- Maintained by MH, so all taxonomic decisions are his
- We hope to **ease the burden** of maintaining a database of >60,000 names by working as a **community**

## Database format of WF

- A custom format using Microsoft Word
- MH has kindly provided us with an exported version of the data (Excel spreadsheet)
- We (PPG) are allowed to use World Ferns data under the [CC BY 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/) license\*
- I wrote custom R code to convert the World Ferns data to **Darwin Core (DwC)** format: <https://github.com/pteridogroup/ppg-import>

# Darwin Core (DwC)

## What is Darwin Core (DwC)?

- A **standard** for taxonomic data
- Actually part of a broader standard for **biodiversity data** (specimens, taxonomy, other collection metadata)
- More info: <https://dwc.tdwg.org/>

---

![](https://docs.ropensci.org/dwctaxon/articles/dwca.png)

## What is a "standard"?

- Provides specifications for **how to format the data**
  - Column names
  - What goes in each column
  - Example: `scientificName`

---

<https://dwc.tdwg.org/list/#dwc_scientificName>

![](images/sci_name.png)

## PPG uses DwC

- The PPG database is a single datatable (a spreadsheet) in CSV (comma-separated values) format that conforms to DwC

---

![](images/ppg-csv-raw.png)

## Why should we use a standard?

- Facilitates **sharing of data** between databases

- Databases that use DwC
  - [GBIF](https://www.gbif.org/)
  - [Catalog of Life](https://www.catalogueoflife.org/)
  - many others...

## DwC helps us *organize* data

- We can have **expectations** about how the data are organized
  - Synonyms should map to accepted names
  - Lower taxonomic levels should map to higher ones
- We can **validate** our data to make sure they meet the expectations (more on that soon...)

## An R package to maintain and validate DwC

::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
- I developed the `dwctaxon` R package to help maintain and validate DwC

- Handling taxonomic changes is not straightforward, **especially when synonyms are involved**
:::
::: {.column width="15%"}
:::
::: {.column width="35%"}
![](https://docs.ropensci.org/dwctaxon/logo.png){width="250px"}
:::
:::

<https://docs.ropensci.org/dwctaxon/>

## Changing taxonomy is *complicated* {.smaller}

Old version:

- Accepted species 1: *Cephalomanes crassum*
  - Synonym: *Trichomanes crassum*
- Accepted species 2: *Cephalomanes densinervium*
  - Synonym: *Trichomanes densinervium*

::: {.fragment}
New version (*C. crassum* → synonym of ***C. densinervium***):
:::

::: {.incremental}
- Accepted species: ***Cephalomanes densinervium***
  - Synonym 1: *Cephalomanes crassum*
  - Synonym 2: *Trichomanes crassum*
  - Synonym 3: *Trichomanes densinervium*
:::

::: {.fragment}
`dwctaxon` can account for **all** synonyms
:::

## It is better to detect mistakes *early*

- There are many possible mistakes with taxonomic data
  - Misspelled names
  - Incorrect accepted name of a synonym
  - non-standard taxonomic status or rank, etc...

## `dwctaxon` automates validation of taxonomic data

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| label: dwctaxon-setup
library(dwctaxon)
library(dplyr)

set.seed(12345)
filmies_dirty <-
  dct_filmies |>
  # Change taxonomic status of one row to 'good'
  dct_modify_row(taxonID = "54115096", taxonomicStatus = "good") |>
  # Duplicate some rows at the end
  bind_rows(tail(dct_filmies)) |>
  # Insert bad values for `acceptedNameUsageID` of 5 random rows
  rows_update(
    tibble(
      taxonID = sample(dct_filmies$taxonID, 5),
      acceptedNameUsageID = sample(letters, 5)
    ),
    by = "taxonID"
  )
```

```{r}
#| label: dwctaxon-show
#| error: true
#| echo: true
dct_validate(filmies_dirty)
```

- I use `dwctaxon` to help edit the data from World Ferns to implement the changes we've voted on so far
- This is helps us maintain a **high-quality** taxonomic database with minimal manual intervention

# ~~PPG Editor~~ WFO and Rhakhis

## PPG II requires a new approach

- PPG I used Google Sheets
- This was OK for a small number of names (genus and above)...
- But PPG II (Phase II, at species level) will include >60,000 names
- **We can't handle all of these with a single Google Sheet**

## Solution: a web app for editing names

- By using a web app, PPG members can simultaneously edit the database while minimizing data entry errors

- I had been developing a custom web app called `ppg-editor`...

---

![](images/ppg-editor.png)

---

- But then I realized that the [Rhakhis](https://rhakhis.rbge.info/) tool of [World Flora Online](https://worldfloraonline.org/) could work just as well (better?) and that it is probably a better option (they have a professional software development staff, I am just doing what I can as a researcher who happens to know some R)

![](images/wofo_abstract.png)

## About [World Flora Online](https://worldfloraonline.org/) (WFO)

- A taxonomic system for all vascular plants and bryophytes

- Each group maintained by a **Taxonomic Expert Network (TEN)**

- PPG is a TEN

![](images/wfo-ppg.png)

## PPG and WFO

- We have not yet provided our data to WFO

- We plan to submit PPG II data as soon as it is ready (Fall/Winter 2024?)

## Rhakhis

- WFO maintains a webb app to edit taxonomic data in the WFO database called "Rhakhis"

> Greek form of rachis, the ‘backbone’ of a leaf or inflorescence

## Rhakhis

- We will use Rhakhis for Phase II (the species-level taxonomy)

## Using Rhakhis

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="80%"}
- Anybody can log in using their [ORCID ID](https://orcid.org/)
  - I can help get you set up with one today if you don't have it yet

- In order to edit data, you need to be given permission for a particular group (likely genus or family)
  - We will be setting this up soon

:::

::: {.column width="20%"}

::::

## Using Rhakhis

- There are two versions of Rhakhis
  - The "normal" editor
  - The "sandbox" editor

- They are identical, except that any changes made in the "sandbox" will be erased overnight (it is for testing only)

![](images/staging.png)

## Using Rhakhis

- I can demo using Rhakhis with the Sandbox version

- You can log in with your ORCID and browse the data, but not edit anything (yet)

- Check the [user manual](https://plant-list-docs.rbge.info/rhakhis/)

## Beyond Phase II: Integrating PPG and FTOL

- Work on a complete, species-level fern tree (FTOL v2) is in early stages
  - current FTOL (v1.6.0): 5,785 species = ca. 50%

- The ultimate goal is to have a **unified**, species-level database including the **taxonomy** and **tree**

## Beyond Phase II: Integrating PPG and FTOL

- We (organizers of PPG and [GoFLAG](https://flagellateplants.org/)) are planning a similar project to GoFLAG to complete FTOL
  - Taxonomic experts can submit tissue samples and have priority access to resulting data
  - We hope that collaboration with all PPG members will result in a **complete** FTOL!
